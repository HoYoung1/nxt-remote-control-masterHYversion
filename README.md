I did change it appropriately when three motor handle





This project is a partial modification of open source at http://code.google.com/p/nxt-remote-control/.

The first thing I did , was modify this project to fit the Android studio environment.

I wanted a more comfortable operation with the 3 motor control, so I modified the 2 motor control layout slightly.

I modified the direction (+ or -) and the speed very slightly to make the nxt robot more comfortable to operate.
