This project is a partial modification of open source at http://code.google.com/p/nxt-remote-control/.

I wanted a more comfortable operation with the 3 motor control, so I modified the 2 motor control layout slightly.

The first thing I did, was get open source and modify it to run in the Android studio environment.

Three motor control is difficult to turn the robot. So I created a view suitable for my robot.

The source code has been modified to allow three motor controls for the two motor control layout.
